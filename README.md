# Force.com Web Service Connector (WSC)

The Force.com Web Service Connector (WSC) is a high performing web service client stack implemented using a streaming parser. WSC also makes it much easier to use the Force.com API (Web Services/SOAP or Asynchronous/BULK API). 

## Building WSC
    git clone git@github.com:forcedotcom/wsc.git
    mvn install -DskipTests
